# Analysis Results & Visualizations

This directory contains the graphical outputs generated by the visualization and analysis scripts.

## Figure Guide

### Machine Learning & Drivers
* **`advanced_feature_importance.png`**: Output of `ml_gradient_boost.py`. A bar chart ranking the top predictors of gut health. **Key finding:** BMI and Phylogenetic Diversity are the strongest predictors, outweighing diet.

### Clinical Biomarkers
* **`antibiotic_impact.png`**: Violin plots showing the distribution of Shannon Diversity over time since antibiotic exposure (Week vs. Month vs. Year). Shows the "crash" and "recovery" trajectory.
* **`medical_biomarkers.png`**: Output of `visualize_biomarkers.py`. Boxplots confirming the significant depletion of *Akkermansia* in obese patients and *Faecalibacterium* in recent antibiotic users.

### Diet & Lifestyle
* **`species_comparison.png`**: Output of `visualize_species.py`. Comparing the *Prevotella* vs. *Bacteroides* ratios between Vegans and High-Meat eaters.
* **`lifestyle_analysis_cleaned.png`**: Output of `visualize_lifestyle.py`. Analysis of Polypharmacy (Vitamin D, Vitamin B, Acne Medication, Multivitamins) showing the lack of significant impact on diversity for most supplements.
* **`targeted_analysis.png`**: Output of `visualize_targeted_questions.py`. Specific hypothesis testing on whether B-Vitamins help Vegans or Probiotics help post-antibiotic patients (Results: No significant impact).
